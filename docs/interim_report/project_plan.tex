\chapter{Project Plan}

Although headway has been made in getting the project off the ground, the majority of key elements are still to be built. It will be necessary to take maximum advantage of the three week gap after the Christmas period and before the semester begins to make major strides in the project. With demo day taking place on the 6th of April 2010 that leaves effectively around twelve weeks to complete the project and the accompanying report.

Below we outline a general month by month plan for the progression of the project. It is difficult at this stage to define a more concrete project plan, this is largely due to the difficult nature of the image processing task.

\begin{tabular*}{0.8\textwidth}{r l}
January & \bf{Three weeks, full time}\\
 & This period will be dedicated to making progress with the\\
 & image/object recognition module of the project, this major\\
 & block of time is being allocated due to the critical importance\\
 & of this module. Extensive documentation will also be kept to\\
 & augment the project report.\\
 & \\
February & \bf{Four weeks, time between university commitments}\\
 & Assuming success with creating a method of fingerprinting.\\
 & Implementation of the Android application and integration with\\
 & the image processing component will take pace during this time.\\
 & Again concurrently work will progress on the report writing and\\
 & tweaking of the image processing mechanism.\\
 & \\
March & \bf{Four weeks, time between university commitments}\\
 & Half of this time will be dedicated to enhancing the image\\
 & processing mechanism developed earlier. The remaining half\\
 & will be utilised for finalising the report and adding\\
 & functionality to the Android application.\\
 & \\
April & \bf{One week, before demo day}\\
 & The week up to Demo day will be consumed with tweaking and\\
 & bug fixing as well as creating the demo environment. To\\
 & display interesting components of the project.\\
