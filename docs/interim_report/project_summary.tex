\chapter*{Summary}

Smartphone hardware has been developing at an ever increasing rate, particularly since 2007 when the Apple iPhone\textsuperscript{\texttrademark} was released. Since then it is not uncommon to have a device with a CPU having a clockspeed in excess of one gigahertz, more than five-hundred and twelve megabytes of RAM. This project will attempt to explore the ability to perform complex image processing on such a device. 

In the introduction we explore the basic elements necessary for creating an application that will take a picture of a leaf and will attempt to identify the family of tree based on processing performed on this image. This section will also highlight some of the issues surrounding the identification process.

In the research section a number of avenues for â€¦..

The current progress section details....

Finally at the rear of the document we layout a plan to allocate the remaining time for components of the project.
