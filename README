Using computer vision techniques to identify tree types using features
discovered from their leaves, enabling the user access online/offline
information about the tree.

Main Aims
Write a Google Android application that incorporates computer vision libraries.
With this software build a model for identifying a leafâ€™s features.
Associate these features extracted from the leaf with a type of tree.
Special Resources Required

Android based mobile device with integrated camera.

Significant Milestones
Getting an Android application with the computer vision library working
Get the same computer vision library running on a development machine
Getting the CV library to communicate with the devices camera.
Modelling an initial leaf
Training the model with new leaves
Linking the detected leaf to known tree types
Creating a user interface
